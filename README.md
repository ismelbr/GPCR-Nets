This web site has been designed to visualize GPCR interaction networks. We distinguish between two types of interaction networks: HetNet and NonHetNet. In the former each receptor is a network node and every line between two receptor means that these two connected receptors interact between them according to consulted literature. In the latter network, however, every dotted line means that the two connected receptors does not interact. In the site you can visualize one of these two networks by clicking on the buttons that appear in the top-left panel.
